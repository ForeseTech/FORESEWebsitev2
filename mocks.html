            <p>
              <b>OUR VISION : </b>
              <br />
              Mock Placements is the flagship event organized by FORESE. It is an annual preparatory event held
              exclusively for the pre-final year students from all departments of our college. The sole intention behind
              hosting MOCKS is that we firmly believe in inclusivity and want to provide an opportunity to the student
              to gain insight and experience on how the actual placements will be held.
              <br /><br />

              <b>HOW WE ACHIEVE OUR GOAL: </b>
              <br />
              Each year we have an attendance of over 100â€™s HRs and other technical personnel from several companies who
              are invited to examine the technical strength of about 800 pre-final year students. They conduct a
              one-on-one interview along with one session of group discussion to gauge the skillsets of the students.
              MOCKS thus acts as a trial run of the actual placements which will be conducted the following year. This
              event has proven to enhance the proficiency of the student by creating a competitive environment and
              directing the student to improve their skills and make them best suited for their career.
              <br /><br />

              <b>WHY MOCKS ARE STUDENT BENEFICIAL: </b>
              <br />
              Provides the interviewee both an opportunity to practice and prepare for an actual interview.
              <br />
              Focuses on enhancing the proficiency of the student by creating a competitive environment for the
              students.
              <br />
              Serves as a medium in directing the student to improve their skills and make them best suited for their
              career.
              <br />
              Aids in boosting the confidence of the student as the interviewer point out the strengths of the
              interviewee during the process.
              <br />
              Students receive constructive feedback from experts from the industry in a low-stress environment.
