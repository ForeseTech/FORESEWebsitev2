              For our students who haven't quenched their thirst for education and are looking to go abroad and pursue
              higher education, we organize an annual ForED fair in the odd semester to help our students explore their
              foreign education opportunities by talking to admission experts. One day access to various foreign
              education consultancy services where students can get all the information they need about higher education
              in various countries such as United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. This is a great
              chance for our students to learn how to improve their applications and get answers to all their questions
              in detail. Students may avail themselves of the services of various training institutes that tutor
              students for necessary exams like TOEFL/IELTS etc and learn more about the process. ForED helps students
              get a clearer picture of the requirements and demands to pursue their dreams.
