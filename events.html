                <span class="title">GROUP DISCUSSION</span>
                <p class="description">
                  A Group Discussion or GD, as it is popularly known, judges the personality of a person. It evaluates
                  the behavioral traits in a person his or her leadership skills, social skills, team skills,
                  problem-solving skills, and presence of mind.
                  <br /><br />
                  Public speaking has always been a nightmare for a lot of students. Statistics say the most feared part
                  of placements among a majority of students is the GD round. Here at Forese, we help you face that
                  fear.
                  <br /><br />
                  As a student, you may think how do I prepare myself for this event?
                  <br /><br />
                  Here are some tips that you can use:
                  <br /><br />
                  <b>1. Rich Content With Good Subject Knowledge : </b><br />
                  Having good subject knowledge and rich content is the first and foremost GD tip to enter the Group
                  Discussion Round.
                  <br /><br />
                  <b>2. Be Relevant : </b><br />
                  When you speak you should speak to the point without any ambiguity of thought expresses your ideas at
                  length. Wherever possible, emphasize your point with facts and figures.
                  <br /><br />
                  <b>3. Be a Good Listener : </b><br />
                  Learn to be a good listener. Listening Skills are Essential for the GD round, so carefully listen to
                  what others have to say. <br /><br />
                  <b>4. Body Gestures: </b><br />
                  The panelists observe the way you sit and react in the course of the discussion. Body gestures are
                  very important because your body language says a lot about you. In a GD, sit straight, avoid leaning
                  back onto the chair or knocking the table with a pen or your fingers. Also, do not get distracted
                  easily. Nervous body movements, folding your hands across your chest, having skeptical expression,
                  constantly moving, evading eye movements are the indicators of a negative personality and should be
                  avoided at all costs.
                  <br /><br />
                  <b>5. Don't Be Aggressive: </b><br />
                  It is expected during the Group Discussion that you are firm on your ideas and are audible enough to
                  make an impact on the group. But being aggressive, shouting, and not allowing others in the group to
                  speak, is not appreciated. So be careful and don’t be a bully.
                  <br /><br />
                  <b>6. Don't Give Up: </b><br />
                  Make multiple entries Don’t be content with one round of one minute or half a minute speaking in the
                  group. Focus on key points, form the ideas and opinions to enter again based on the views presented by
                  others to further strengthen your viewpoint but at the same let others speak their time as well.
                  <br /><br />
                  <b>7. Be A Leader, Not A Follower: </b><br />
                  As much as it is true that GD tests your team player skills, it also tests participants' willingness
                  to take responsibility and lead the conversation.
                  <br /><br />
                  We hope these tips will help you succeed and crush any GD rounds you will attend in your career.
